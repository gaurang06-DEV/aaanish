What is DHCP?

What is DHCP?

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically
assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (like subnet mask, default
gateway, and DNS server) to devices (clients) on a network.

Key Points

Automates IP configuration: No need to manually assign IP addresses to each device.

Reduces errors: Helps avoid IP conflicts and configuration mistakes.

Centralized management: All settings are handled by a DHCP server.

Example Use Case

When you connect your laptop or phone to Wi-Fi, DHCP is what gives your device an IP
address and allows it to communicate with the internet.

DHCP Architecture

DHCP Client-Any device (PC, mobile, printer) that needs an IP address.

DHCP Server-A server (can be on a router, dedicated server, etc.) configured to manage and
lease IP addresses.

DHCP Relay Agent-A network device (usually a router) that forwards DHCP messages
between clients and a remote DHCP server.

Commonly used term DHCP

IP Address Pool

It is the pool or container of IP
Addresses possessed by the DHCP
Server. It has a range of addresses
that can be allocated to devices.

Lease

It is simply the time that how long
the information received from the
server is valid, in case of expiration
of the lease, the tenant must have
to re-assign the lease.

Working of DHCP

DHCP works on the Application layer of the UDP Protocol.

The DHCP port number for the server is 67 and for the client is 68.

In DHCP, the client and the server exchange mainly 4 DHCP messages in order to
make a connection, also called the DORA process, but there are 8 DHCP messages
in the process.

DORA Process

Discover – Client broadcasts to locate server.

Offer – Server offers IP configuration.

Request – Client requests offered configuration.

Acknowledgement – Server confirms assignment.

DHCP Discover Message: This is the first message generated in the communication
process between the server and the client. This message is generated by the Client host
in order to discover if there is any DHCP server/servers are present in a network or not.
This message is broadcasted to all devices present in a network to find the DHCP server.
This message is 342 or 576 bytes long.

DHCP Offers A Message: The server will respond to the host in this message specifying
the unleased IP address and other TCP configuration information. This message is
broadcasted by the server. The size of the message is 342 bytes. If there is more than
one DHCP server present in the network then the client host will accept the first DHCP
OFFER message it receives. Also, a server ID is specified in the packet in order to
identify the server.

DHCP Request Message: When a client receives an offer message, it responds by
broadcasting a DHCP request message. The client will produce a gratuitous ARP in order
to find if there is any other host present in the network with the same IP address. If
there is no reply from another host, then there is no host with the same TCP
configuration in the network and the message is broadcasted to the server showing the
acceptance of the IP address. A Client ID is also added to this message.

DHCP Acknowledgment Message: In response to the request message received, the
server will make an entry with a specified client ID and bind the IP address offered with
lease time. Now, the client will have the IP address provided by the server.

Security Considerations

To make sure your DHCP servers are safe, consider these DHCP security
issues:

Limited IP Addresses : A DHCP server can only offer a set number
of IP addresses. This means attackers could flood the server with
requests, causing essential devices to lose their connection.

Fake DHCP Servers : Attackers might set up fake DHCP servers to
give out fake IP addresses to devices on your network.

DNS Access : When users get an IP address from DHCP, they also
get DNS server details. This could potentially allow them to access
more data than they should.

HTTP & HTTPS

The Foundation of Web
Communication

HTTP Overview

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used by the World Wide
Web to define how messages are formatted and transmitted between
clients and servers.

HTTP is stateless, meaning that each request-response cycle is
independent.

It runs over TCP (usually port 80) and is responsible for fetching
resources such as HTML pages, images, and videos.

HTTP Methods

GET

Retrieves data from the server. This is the most common method used to
request a webpage or other resources.

POST

Sends data to the server, often to create a new resource. For example,
submitting a form or uploading a file.

PUT

Replaces an existing resource with the data provided in the request body. If the
resource doesn't exist, it may be created.

PATCH

Partially updates an existing resource. Only the provided fields in the request
body are modified.

DELETE

Removes a resource from the server.

Cookies

Cookies are small text files that a web server sends to a user's
browser.

The browser stores these files and sends them back to the server
with subsequent requests to the same domain.

Cookies are used for various purposes, such as maintaining login
status, storing user preferences, tracking user behavior, and
managing shopping carts.

There are different types of cookies, including

Session cookies: Deleted when the browser is closed.

Persistent cookies: Stored on the user's device for a set duration.

Secure cookies: Transmitted only over HTTPS connections.

Sessions

Sessions refer to a way for a server to maintain stateful information across
multiple HTTP requests from the same user.

Since HTTP is stateless, sessions enable the server to track user interactions by
assigning a unique session ID.

This ID is often stored in a cookie and sent with each request.

The server uses the ID to retrieve session data stored on the server, such as login
status, cart contents, or form data

Session storage is typically temporary and expires after a set time of
inactivity or when the user logs out.

Unlike cookies, session data is not stored on the client side.

HTTPS – Secure HTTP

Need for
HTTPS

HTTP does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and
attacks.

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds a layer of security using SSL/TLS protocols.

It ensures

Confidentiality: Encrypts data

Integrity: Prevents tampering

Authentication: Confirms server identity

SSL/TLS Handshake

Establishes a secure connection.

Involves digital certificates and key exchange.

Client Hello: Browser proposes encryption options

Server Hello: Server picks options and sends digital
certificate

Certificate Validation: Client verifies server identity via CA

Key Exchange: Client and server securely exchange keys

Secure Connection: Encrypted communication begins

Handshake

HTTP vs HTTPS Comparison

DNS & TLDs

Domain Name System and Top-Level
Domains

What is DNS?

Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet.

It translates domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into IP addresses (e.g.,
142.250.180.78) required by computers to communicate.

DNS Hierarchy

DNS is organized in a hierarchical, distributed database
structure

Root Server

The top of the hierarchy (denoted by "."). Directs queries to the
correct TLD server. There are 13 logical root servers worldwide.

Top-Level Domain (TLD)

The next level (.com, .org, .edu, .in). Managed by domain
registries.

Second-Level Domain

Directly below TLDs (e.g., "google" in google.com). Chosen by
domain registrants.

Subdomain

Optional part added before the domain (e.g., "www" or "mail" in
mail.google.com). Used to organize or host different services.

DNS Resolution Process

The process used to translate domain names into IP addresses

User types a URL in the browser

DNS Resolver (often at ISP) checks its
cache

If not found, a recursive query is made
to a root server

Root refers to appropriate TLD server

TLD refers to Authoritative Name
Server

IP address is returned to the resolver,
then the browser

Types of DNS
Queries

Iterative Query

Resolver asks each server in turn. If the
server doesn't know the answer, it points
to another server.

Recursive Query

Resolver takes full responsibility and
continues querying until it finds an
answer or an error.

Domain Registration and
ICANN

ICANN

Non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and
procedures of databases related to the namespaces of the Internet.

Registrars

Accredited companies (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) where users can purchase
domain names.

WHOIS

A query protocol used to get information about domain ownership,
registration, and contact details.
